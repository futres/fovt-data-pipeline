# FuTRES loading from command-line python examples

These scripts use python 3+
You may need to pip install required modules as python complains about them

futres_validator.py tests data only and doesn't load
futres_uploader.py loads data from command line

```
# test running code, like:
python futres_validator.py test.csv
```
